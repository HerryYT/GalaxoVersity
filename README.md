# Galaxoversity

Galaxy Life was a space themed real time strategy building game developed by Ubisoft. However it was shut down in March 2016 and isn't playable anymore.

The aim of Galaxiversity is to eventually write a working community server for Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures (the mobile version of Galaxy Life) and to revive the game again.

To avoid any copyright problems, we'll use the original client (the app) without any modifications and write the server completely from scratch. However to do that, we'll first have to start by reversing the Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures app, to figure out how it communicated with the servers. The server will be written in Java.

If you have any knowledge in Java/Android reverse engineering or programming in general you're welcome to help. Right now we're just collecting all the information we can get about the inner workings of the client, so just make a pull request where you add anything you found out.

The latest version of GL:PA is 1.7.0 so we'll use that. I won't upload it for obvious copyright reasons, however it's easy to find on Google. To confirm you've downloaded the correct file you can check it's checksum:
