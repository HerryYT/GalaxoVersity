# GalaxyLifeRevived

Galaxy Life is a game developed by Ubisoft. However unfortunately it was shut down in March 2016.

The aim of this project is to eventually write a working community server for Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures (the mobile version of Galaxy Life).

To avoid any copyright problems we'll use the original client (the App) and write the server completely from scratch. However to do that, we'll first have to start by reversing the Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures app, to figure out how it communicated with the servers.

If you have any knowledge in Java/Android reverse engineering or programming in general you're welcome to help. Right now we're just collecting info about the inner workings of the client, so just make a pull request where you add anything you found out.

The latest version of GLPA is 1.7.0 so we'll use that. To confirm you've downloaded the correct file you can check it's checksum:
